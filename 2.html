                    In March 2020, Sophia and Steve Alcorn found themselves stranded in a one-bedroom apartment in Elmhurst, 
                    Queens. The married couple had just left Kentucky and moved to New York after Steve Alcorn started his 
                    residency in Elmhurst hospital. Sophia Alcorn feels alienated in the neighborhood, famous for its 
                    diversity, and finds comfort in the arms of a local young man. Meanwhile, Steve finds himself working 
                    extra hours volunteering with the rest of the hospital team, facing an epidemic they didn't know before. 
                    Elmhurst hospital found itself at the center of the storm, with a disproportionate number of critically 
                    ill people and deaths, and young Dr. Alcorn is overwhelmed by the swift changes in his private life and 
                    the morbid atmosphere at work. Affected by the situation, Sophia Alcorn decides to volunteer at a crisis 
                    line, where she surprisingly befriends a young woman called Annie. The young couple drifts apart.

                    This Comedy Drama weaves together issues that were exacerbated by the pandemic in New York City: 
                    alienation, contemporary mythologies, and distorted mirroring created by the media, celebrities, and pop 
                    culture.

                    Production Notes:Good People is based on an original screenplay. The film was shot in Elmhurst, Queens, 
                    NY, in the director's apartment, with unprofessional actors. The one continuous shot and the decision not 
                    to tell a real-time storyline turns the film into cinema, theater, and home video.

                    We worked on this film like a theater play. Memorizing the movements and text each day, which took a total 
                    of 4 weeks of rehearsal. The camera kept running in the dark parts. We closed the windows and turned off 
                    the lights to create this effect. I darkened it later more with post-production. Actors and production 
                    manager/DA had to switch the rooms from day to night and also change the set, lighting, costume and props.

                    Good People is the first one-continous shot feature by a female director in the US. It's the first 
                    one-shot film where the director is also the scriptwriter and the camera.

                    Good People is funded by the Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts US & Canada.
