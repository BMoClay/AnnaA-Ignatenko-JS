                    Blake and Lexine, my two childhood best friends. Their father, Todd, 
                    worked at the Red Lion Inn, and their mom, Jill, was a busy 
                    stay-at-home pampered chef consultant.  While my mom worked two jobs 
                    and was never home, my own solitude was frightening and also 
                    considered illegal. I found homage within their family unit, and they 
                    willfully took me in. I spent a lot of time with the Hagens throughout 
                    my elementary school days. My favorite dish by Jill was this 
                    questionable but yummy American/Chinese clash of melted cheddar 
                    cheese in white rice with soy sauce and sliced chicken, sometimes, she 
                    would switch out the soy sauce for this tangy BBQ sauce.                     
                </p>
                <p>
                    My entire upbringing is colored by trying to find homage in other 
                    homes and other families. This longing still exists, even in my 
                    thirties. By 5th grade, the cruel whims of childhood ostracization 
                    turned its gaze upon my friendship with Blake and Lexine. They, 
                    especially Blake, who was relegated to the 'special' group, were 
                    branded as 'other', a label I never understood. They were not 'other'; 
                    they were my refuge, my adopted family in a world where normalcy was a 
                    shifting, elusive shadow.
